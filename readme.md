# Food Refined TT
Food Refined TT is a project undertaken by three final year UWI Computer Science Students to reduce food wastage and hunger in Trinidad and Tobago. Restaurants/Supermarkets are allowed to browse a list of shelters and choose which one they would like to donate to. From here, the donation items can either be delivered to the destination or picked up by the shelters. 

# Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to reduce the amount of food wastage produced by restaurants who dispose of their leftover foods. This food disposal contributes negatively to the environment as it releases toxic gases into the atmosphere.
